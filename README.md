The website puts visitors in the theme of Call of Duty Zombies with a dark background (zomb1.jpg) and black color scheme. I used fonts like "Creepster" and "Nosifer" for their bold and thematic appeal, enhancing the presentation. Navigation is clear, with large text links to sections like Maps and Perks featuring hover effects for engagement. This ensures easy access to relevant content for users navigating to different pages.
Pages (Maps, Perks) use semantic HTML for structured content. Each section includes descriptive headers accompanied by images and detailed descriptions to engage users. The Maps page get into the worlds of iconic game locations, highlighting their unique features and gameplay dynamics. From the eerie moon base to the medieval castle of Der Eisendrache, each map description captures the essence of its setting and challenges.
The Perks page uses an interactive accordion design using CSS and radio inputs. This intuitive layout allows users to expand sections (Juggernog, Speed Cola, etc.) to discover detailed perk descriptions, including their effects and uses in gameplay. Semantic HTML ensured logical content structure, complemented by CSS for consistent styling. Background images and fonts maintained a cohesive visual identity throughout the site.
While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the design principles support potential responsiveness across devices. Future enhancements could include media queries for optimal viewing on various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience for users accessing the site from different devices. Engaging descriptions highlight gameplay elements, supported by visuals to enhance immersion on the website.
The iterative development process focused on refining design details and functionality. Future improvements might include incorporating CSS animations to add dynamic visual elements and additional interactive features to further engage users. Overall, the website aims to captivate fans of Call of Duty Zombies by providing comprehensive information in an immersive and visually appealing format, with ongoing updates and enhancements to enrich the user experience.
